Jon joined the Night's Watch where he served as steward to Lord Commander Mormont. After Mormont’s death, Jon was elected Lord Commander of the Watch, and made the unpopular decision to ally with the wildlings and save them from the White Walkers. For that, he was murdered at Castle Black by his own men, but to the awe of everyone, Jon was brought back to life by the Red Priestess Melisandre.",
        bioextended: "Restored as Lord Commander, Jon executed his murderers before abdicating his command and passing it on to Edd Tollett. He swore off all fighting, until a reunion with his long-lost sister Sansa persuaded him to retake Winterfell. With a rag-tag army of Northern allies and the crucial last-minute support of the Vale, Jon led the Starks to victory in the Battle of the Bastards and reclaimed their childhood home. Impressed with his leadership, the Northern houses proclaimed him King in the North. Jon met with Daenerys Targaryen in hopes of forming an alliance, and has returned to the North armed with the dragonglass Dany permitted him to mine. To convince Cersei Lannister of the looming threat, Jon plans to lead a small band of men beyond the Wall and return with a wight to prove the existence of the army of the dead."
